# Part 1: A guide to asynchronous programming in Rust

This part of the book is a tutorial-style guide to async Rust. It is aimed at newcomers to async programming in Rust. It should be useful whether or not you've done async programming in other languages. If you have, you might skip the first section or skim it as a refresher. You might also want to read this [comparison to async in other languages]() sooner rather than later.

We'll start by discussing different models of [concurrent programming](concurrency.md), using processes, threads, or async tasks. This chapter will cover the essential parts of Rust's async model before we get into the nitty-gritty of programming in the second chapter where we introduce the async and await syntax.
